# Startup Marketing Glossary
Hi there 👋🏻 The glossary below is a collection of terms I encountered during my product marketing journey. I come from software engineering and ended up doing marketing just by sheer desire to help more folks get maximum value from the projects I was working on.

'Traditional' marketing is full of acronyms, concepts, theories and more. It can seem overwhelming at first (or even confusing..), but in the end I think it boils down to rather simple considerations if you take it right from the right angle (making cool products that users enjoy using).

# Who is this for?
- Software engineers
- Startup founders (especially SaaS startups)
- **Product** Marketers
- or any other newcomer in Marketing wonderland, who's looking for simple guidance and practical knowledge
